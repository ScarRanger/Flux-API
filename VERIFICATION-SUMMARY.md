## 🔍 5 Ways to Verify (In Order of Ease)

### 1. **Watch Keeper Logs** (Easiest!)
Open the keeper window and make a purchase. You'll see:
```
💰 [PURCHASE] New purchase request
   Buyer: user123
   Listing: 5
   Package: 100 calls
   ✅ Purchase completed successfully!
```

### 2. **Check Purchase Stats**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/purchase-stats
```
Make a purchase, run again. `totalProcessed` will increase!

### 3. **Check Purchase Response**
Look for this in your purchase API response:
```json
{
  "decentralized": true,
  "keeper": {
    "nodeId": "keeper-node-1",
    "walletAddress": "0x447e555CA6664bbDF5f7cd6FF4878F7c1a54f44e"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Check Database**
```sql
SELECT id, buyer_uid, processed_by_keeper, created_at 
FROM purchases 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```
If `processed_by_keeper = "keeper-node-1"` → ✅ Decentralized!

### 5. **Check Blockchain**
Visit: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x447e555CA6664bbDF5f7cd6FF4878F7c1a54f44e
Look for transactions from keeper's wallet.

## 📊 Before vs After

### BEFORE (Centralized):
```
User → Main App → Database
            ↓
      Blockchain (from user)
```

### AFTER (Decentralized) - NOW ACTIVE:
```
User → Main App → Keeper Selection → KEEPER NODE → Database
                                           ↓
                                      Access Key Gen
                                      Blockchain TX
                                      Purchase Record
```

## 🧪 Quick Test Right Now

Open 2 windows side by side:

**Window 1:** Keeper logs (already running)
**Window 2:** Run this:

     Start-Sleep 5
   }
   ```

2. **Check Last 5 Purchases:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM purchases 
   WHERE processed_by_keeper IS NOT NULL 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Verify Access Keys:**
   ```sql
   SELECT access_key, created_by_keeper, created_at 
   FROM api_access 
   WHERE created_by_keeper IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
