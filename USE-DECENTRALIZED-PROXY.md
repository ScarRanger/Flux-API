# üöÄ Using the Decentralized Proxy Network

## Overview
Your API requests are now routed through **keeper nodes** instead of directly from your server. This provides:
- ‚úÖ **Decentralization**: No single point of failure
- ‚úÖ **Load Balancing**: Requests distributed across multiple keepers
- ‚úÖ **Privacy**: API keys encrypted in keeper vaults
- ‚úÖ **Transparency**: Every call tracked with keeper info

---

## How It Works

```
Buyer Request ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí Keeper Selection ‚Üí Keeper Node ‚Üí Third-party API
                  ‚Üì           ‚Üì                  ‚Üì
              Validate    Load Balance      Decrypt Key
              API Key     Pick Keeper       Make Call
```

## Making Transactions

### Method 1: Using the Gateway API (Recommended)

**Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:3000/api/gateway/proxy`

**Headers**:
```
Content-Type: application/json
X-BNB-API-Key: your_bnb_api_key_here
```

**Body**:
```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/joke/Any"
}
```

**Example with curl**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/gateway/proxy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-BNB-API-Key: bnb_dc739855131070573e81f52408a7b1170dee7fabf3c8734e1a1cbf32371c5762" \
  -d '{
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/joke/Any"
  }'
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "joke": "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!",
    "type": "programming"
  },
  "keeper": {
    "nodeId": "keeper-node-1",
    "walletAddress": "0x447e555CA6664bbDF5f7cd6FF4878F7c1a54f44e",
    "endpoint": "http://localhost:3001",
    "responseTime": 234
  },
  "quota": {
    "used": 1,
    "remaining": 999
  }
}
```

---

### Method 2: Using JavaScript/Fetch

```javascript
async function callApiThroughProxy() {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/gateway/proxy', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-BNB-API-Key': 'your_bnb_api_key_here'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      method: 'GET',
      path: '/joke/Any'
    })
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  
  if (result.success) {
    console.log('API Response:', result.data);
    console.log('Routed through keeper:', result.keeper.nodeId);
    console.log('Quota remaining:', result.quota.remaining);
  }
}
```

---

### Method 3: Using the Test Script

We've created a comprehensive test script:

```bash
# Run all tests
node test-decentralized-proxy.js
```

This will:
1. Check gateway health
2. Make a single API call through proxy
3. Make 5 calls to test load balancing
4. Compare centralized vs decentralized routing

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Keeper Selection**
The gateway automatically selects the best keeper based on:
- Active status
- Reputation score
- Current load (least busy)

### 2. **Quota Tracking**
Every request tracks your API key quota:
```json
"quota": {
  "used": 5,
  "remaining": 995,
  "limit": 1000
}
```

### 3. **Keeper Statistics**
Each response includes keeper performance:
```json
"keeper": {
  "nodeId": "keeper-node-1",
  "walletAddress": "0x447e555CA6664bbDF5f7cd6FF4878F7c1a54f44e",
  "responseTime": 234
}
```

### 4. **Database Tracking**
Every call is logged in `api_calls` table with:
- `keeper_node_id` - Which keeper handled it
- `blockchain_tx_hash` - Blockchain verification (if enabled)
- `latency_ms` - Response time
- `is_successful` - Success/failure status

---

## Testing Your Setup

### Quick Health Check
```bash
# Check keeper node
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Check gateway
curl http://localhost:3000/api/gateway/proxy
```

### View Keeper Statistics
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/stats
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "nodeId": "keeper-node-1",
  "tasksProcessed": 5,
  "tasksSucceeded": 5,
  "tasksFailed": 0,
  "successRate": 100,
  "vaultSize": 1
}
```

### View Encrypted Vault
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/vault
```

Shows API keys stored in keeper's encrypted vault:
```json
{
  "totalKeys": 1,
  "keys": [
    {
      "listingId": "1",
      "isEncrypted": true,
      "keyPreview": "ENCRYPTED..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Comparison: Centralized vs Decentralized

### Centralized (Old Way)
```
POST /api/gateway/call
‚Üí Server decrypts API key
‚Üí Server makes API call
‚Üí Returns response

‚ùå Single point of failure
‚ùå Server holds all keys
‚ùå Not scalable
```

### Decentralized (New Way)
```
POST /api/gateway/proxy
‚Üí Gateway selects keeper
‚Üí Keeper decrypts key from vault
‚Üí Keeper makes API call
‚Üí Returns response with keeper info

‚úÖ Distributed across keepers
‚úÖ Keys encrypted in keeper vaults
‚úÖ Scalable with multiple keepers
‚úÖ Load balancing
‚úÖ Tracked on blockchain
```

---

## Adding More Keeper Nodes

To scale your network, start additional keeper nodes on different ports:

```bash
# Keeper Node 2
cd keeper-node
PORT=3002 NODE_ID=keeper-node-2 node server.js

# Keeper Node 3
PORT=3003 NODE_ID=keeper-node-3 node server.js
```

The gateway will automatically distribute requests across all active keepers.

---

## Monitoring

### Check Network Status
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/network`

Shows:
- ‚úÖ Active keeper nodes
- üìä Statistics per keeper
- üíé Reputation scores
- üîê Wallet addresses

### Database Queries

**Check recent calls with keeper info**:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  keeper_node_id,
  method,
  path,
  is_successful,
  latency_ms,
  created_at
FROM api_calls 
WHERE keeper_node_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

**Keeper performance**:
```sql
SELECT 
  keeper_node_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_calls,
  SUM(CASE WHEN is_successful THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
  AVG(latency_ms) as avg_latency
FROM api_calls 
WHERE keeper_node_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY keeper_node_id;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No active keepers available"
```bash
# Check if keeper node is running
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Restart keeper node
cd keeper-node
node server.js
```

### "Invalid API key"
Make sure you're using a valid BNB marketplace API key in the header:
```
X-BNB-API-Key: bnb_your_key_here
```

### "API key not found in keeper vault"
The keeper needs to load the API key first. This happens automatically on first use, but you can manually load keys:
```bash
# The keeper will load keys when it receives a request
# Or restart the keeper to reload from database
```

---

## Security Notes

1. **Encryption**: API keys are encrypted in the database and in keeper vaults
2. **HTTPS**: In production, use HTTPS for all endpoints
3. **Authentication**: Only valid BNB API keys can access the proxy
4. **Rate Limiting**: Quota enforcement prevents abuse
5. **Monitoring**: All requests logged for audit trail

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test the proxy with your API key
2. ‚úÖ Monitor requests in the `/network` dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Check database for keeper_node_id in api_calls
4. ‚úÖ Add more keeper nodes for scaling
5. ‚úÖ Integrate blockchain verification (optional)
